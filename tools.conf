# =============================================================================
# NPM global packages
# =============================================================================
#
# Note: For React/Next.js projects, most people use npx with local project
# dependencies rather than global installs. Modern alternatives:
#   - npm create vite@latest    Fast, modern bundler (most popular for React)
#   - npx create-next-app       Full-stack React with SSR/SSG
# These use npx/npm create so you always get the latest version without
# global installs. The packages below are for quick scripts and CLI usage.

# TypeScript & JavaScript - Commented (uncomment to enable)
#npm:typescript      # TypeScript compiler (tsc) - type-check and compile TS to JS
#npm:tsx             # Fast TS executor - run .ts files directly, faster than ts-node
#npm:eslint          # JavaScript/TypeScript linter - catch bugs and enforce style
#npm:prettier        # Code formatter - consistent formatting for JS/TS/CSS/HTML

# =============================================================================
# UV tools - Python CLI applications (installed via uv tool install)
# =============================================================================
#
# Note: Only CLI tools belong here (commands you run from terminal).
# Libraries like numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, pytorch should be
# installed per-project, not globally:
#   - uv add numpy          In a uv-managed project
#   - pip install numpy     In a virtual environment
# This keeps projects isolated and reproducible.

# Python Development - Commented (uncomment to enable)
